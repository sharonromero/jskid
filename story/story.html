     <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "Big Blue." One day, you're working on tuning up your ship's engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
    <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
    <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting of the Master Gardeners tonight, and you were really looking forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Master Gardeners would understand that this mission is very important.</p>
    <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>

<div class="storyPart" id="answer02">

    <p>Great choice! Mars is lovely this time of year (or, during the time of the year when you'll arrive, about 260 days from now!).</p>
    <p>You pack up your things and prepare enough food for the journey, then take off!</p>
    <p>The launch goes smoothly and you sit back, put on your headphones, and prepare for a relaxing trip.</p>
    <p>The next day, things are going great. There's nothing for you to do except read, listen to music, and watch movies. Just then, you hear a strange sound.</p>
    <p><i class="fas fa-cat"></i> "Meow" <i class="fas fa-cat"></i></p>
    <p>It sounds like Sergeant Carter, your cat! He must have snuck aboard while you were packing!</p>
    <p>You're happy to have the company, but you didn't pack enough food for the both of you, and there certainly isn't a grocery store on the way to Mars.</p>
    <p>You have a choice: risk running out of food on the return trip, or turn around now and go home. What will you do?</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
    <p>You decide to stay home. They'll get someone else to fly to Mars. Besides, you heard that they're going to have free pizza at the Master Gardeners' meeting!</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="err1">
    <p>Please answer Mars or Earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
    <p>You decide to risk it. The journey is long, and you give Sergeant Carter half your food, knowing that you may not survive the return trip, but Big Blue can carry the robot home without you, and at least the important experimental data (and Sergeant Carter, of course) will be safe.</p>
    <p>When you arrive at Mars, you quickly locate the sick robot. But, you also discover something else: a large ice chest full of delicious sandwiches! The last repair crew to visit the robot must have left this here! You unwrap one of the sandwiches and carefully take a bite. Peanut butter! Your favorite! Sergeant Carter's favorite too!</p>
    <p>You pack up the sandwiches and the sick robot and begin the trip home, knowing that there's now more than enough food for both you and Sergeant Carter.</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
    <p>Let someone else get the robot. You turn Big Blue around and head home.</p>
    <p>When you get back to the spaceport, you open the door to exit your spaceship and your boss is standing outside.</p>
    <p>You apologize and explain the whole thing to her about how there wouldn't have been enough food.</p>
    <p>Steam comes out of your boss's mechanical head as she tells you that there are always plenty of sandwiches on Mars, and that you would have been just fine if you had completed your mission. She fires you. You pick up Sergeant Carter and start walking home.</p>
    <p>Oh well, at least you still have Sergeant Carter!</p>
